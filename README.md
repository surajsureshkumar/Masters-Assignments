### skyscrapers.py
- Validates a Skyscraper puzzle configuration based on standard puzzle rules.
- Reads puzzle size, clues, and matrix layout from a structured text file.
- Ensures matrix values are in the valid range and checks for duplicates in rows and columns.
- Performs directional visibility checks (North, South, East, West) to verify that the number of visible skyscrapers from each clue matches expectations.
- Prints helpful debug messages to highlight any invalid entries or visibility mismatches.


### quilt_design.py
- Draws a quilt composed of three blocks using Python's Turtle graphics.
- Initializes the drawing canvas and constructs a uniform square border for each quilt block.
- Block 1: Draws four large purple triangles and interleaved small red triangles in a circular layout.
- Block 2: Creates colored triangle pairs in four directional quadrants using loops and position resets.
- Block 3: Generates a colorful spiral design with a bounding square, showcasing creativity and independent design.
- Uses structured positioning and color loops to create visually appealing geometric patterns.


### food_truck.py
- Demonstrates QuickSort and QuickSelect algorithms to solve a facility location problem.
- Reads a list of building positions from an input file, assuming the last column in each line represents a coordinate.
- Applies QuickSort to find the median position for minimal total distance calculation.
- Uses QuickSelect for an optimized approach to find the median without fully sorting the list.
- Compares the execution time and total distance of both approaches to highlight performance differences.
- Useful in real-world scenarios like choosing optimal food truck or warehouse locations based on customer spread.
