This is the implementation of the three search algorithms used:
    1. canReachDFS: Can start reach end using recursive DSF (yes or no)?
    2. findPathDFS: Find any path from start to end, if one exists,
        using recursive DFS.
    3. findShortestPath:  Find the shortest path from start to end,
        if one exists, iteratively using BFS and a queue.
